Hash-Join & Parallel Group-By (Count) implementation in MaReduce
================================================================

Implemented the `Group-By` and `Hash-Join` operations in Hadoop MapReduce, for the requirements of the course "Advanced Topics in Databases" @ TUC (2015).

`Hash-Join` implementation is a parallelized version of the *Grace Hash Join* algorithm.
